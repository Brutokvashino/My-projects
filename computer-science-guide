Virtualbox:
[Installation]
You will need at least 4GB of RAM, 10GB HD free.
Installation features will use about 948KB of HD
In BIOS settings, is virtualization enabled? If not, reboot, while there go to your Boot Settings under Advanced and enable virtualization.
You may want the Extension Pack provided by VirtualBox for the same version you already installed. 
VB will probably show GB in binary MBs so each GB = 1024MB
Check to see how much RAM you normally are using. With 8GB RAM, you can give 2GB to the VM
It will recommend 10GB HD space. You can go into settings after making your VM and boost that if you want to. You can also increase the number of CPUs for the VM if your machine has a lot of CPUs. 
Within Storage, you must select whatever OS you downloaded for the empty the Secondary Optical Disk option, so that it can boot using that OS.
After installing the OS, you want to remove whatever .iso file is in the Secondary Optical Disk storage
Under Machine options, using NAT, you can connect with the internet.
VMs will not be able to copy clipboard or files unless allowed in features
[Features]
Right Ctrl may be the default Host button to allow you to return to controlling your host computer.
You can press right ctrl + F to exit full screen mode.
You can select Auto-scaled output on your Virtual Screen View setting.
VB allows you to save the state of your virtual computer to continue wherever you left off.

Ubuntu:
Ubuntu is a Linux-type OS

History:
Bash history is stored in different places depending on if “Shell” was used or “Z-Shell” 
Manage Linux hist

MySQL:
Make your first SQL db

BIOS:
When booting device, continuously press F12 (Razer), F8, F7, F2 (ASUS), or Esc to access the BIOS options *On ASUS, F2 gives a more in-depth admin view while Esc lets you select how to boot the device.
Enable virtualization under the Advanced tab, may look like (cpu config:) VMX / Intel / AMDv / VTX

Can adjust order of the booting devices

Booting order (Macintosh and Windows)
Power good, CPU, POST (power on self test), boot loader, OS

Troubleshooting Methodology:
1. Identify the problem
2. Establish a theory for possible cause of failure
3. Test theory to identify the actual cause of failure
4. Establish/draft a plan for solving the issue + execute the plan
5. Verify full system functionality, if needed: draft another plan
6. Document the process

Migrating:
Windows:
USMT user state migration tool, transfers a lot of users at once
Windows Easy Transfer, transfers user data and state for one machine
UDMT user data migration tool?

Network Security and Encryption Types:
Open - no password, no encryption, and open for the public to connect
WEP Wired equivalent privacy (WEP) is an older mechanism for encrypting data sent over a wireless connection. WEP is considered vulnerable to attacks that could probably break its encryption. WEP relies on the use of a 24-bit initialization vector to secure its preshared key.
WPA protected access (WPA) is an improved encryption scheme for protecting Wi-Fi communications designed to replace WEP. WPA uses the RC4 cipher and a temporal key integrity protocol (TKIP)
WPA2 auto update. wpa2-aes secure, passwd 8-63 chars, open/web/hidden not secure, use guest network , connected devices 802.11i security standard. WPA2 features an improved method of key distribution and authentication for enterprise networks, though the pre-shared key method is still available for home and small office networks. WPA2 uses the improved AES cipher with counter mode with cipher-block chaining message authentication protocol (CCMP) for encryption.
WPA3 
WAF web application firewall

Network Structure LAN:

Bus

Ring

Hybrid

Spine/Leaf model = TOR/leaf (top of rack) switches are fully meshed to spine (backbone) switches so that intercommunication (East-West-bound traffic) between racks is only 2 hops. All switches are layer 3 switches. Load balancing. Moderately powered spine switches with many ports. Fiber cabling is normally used in data centers.
[EW-traffic (data center), $$$ cabling]

Campus model = 3-tier network (with additional 2-tier possible) for North-Sound-bound traffic (to and from internet). “Spanning Tree” loop-preventing mechanism at the 2nd layer of communication shuts off communication to keep only one of the switches open in the redundant cabling to prevent a Switching Loop (which would break the network). 
[NS-traffic, $$$ core switches]

Tier 3: Core Layer (one 3-tier model per campus)
Fastest connection, low latency, high reliability
[core layer switches]
Tier 2: Distribution Layer (Aggregation layer)
Routing, route filtering, interVLAN, management ACLs and IPS filtering, security policies, summarization, next-hop redundancy
[for multilayer (layer 3) switches]
Tier 1: Access Layer [for layer 2 switches]

2-tier model / Collapsed Core model = the distribution switches do the job of core switches
[$$redundancy for small business]

Daisy-chaining Switches = no redundancy, SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE [$ for home networks]

Spine/Leaf model with Overlay: network automation, Cisco ACI
Underlay: Tier 2: Spine switches (with TOR switches fully meshed)
Tier 1: Racks and TOR switches (layer 3)

Network Structure WAN:

Cable: hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) modem provides bi-directional data on RFoG radio frequency over glass on a coaxial cable. Delivers broadband using high bandwidth infrastructure. 
FTTH fiber (up) to the house: provides 1Gbps+
FTTC curb/cabinet then uses copper to supply local area (100-200Mbps)
FTTN to the node.

Satellite connection uses a VSAT very small aperture terminal microwave antenna aimed at an orbital satellite.

DSL digital subscriber line uses telephone lines, RJ-11 (6 pin) connector and copper TP cables to supply internet. Connects to local switching center and multiplexes using DSLAM to the central office over high-speed cable (ex: fiber)
Microfilter at the telephone port prevents the data signals and voice call interference.
Mostly asymmetric (ADSL), meaning that the uplink (up to about 1.4 Mbps) is slower than the downlink (up to about 24 Mbps). Maximum distance is 3 miles.

Leased Line (Legacy):
WAN Connection from ISP reserved as sole traffic, speeds: T1=1.54 mbps, T3=43.736 mbps (European: E1=2.048, E3=34.368mbps)
[OLD, $$$$, slow, <SD-WAN]

ATM asynchronous transfer mode. Legacy technology like Leased Line. Transfers data in fixed 53-byte cells. Can transfer different types of traffic even IP packets, circuit-switched voice, and video while still maintaining QoS. SD-WAN can accomplish the same.
[OLD, $$$, <SD-WAN]

Frame Relay
[OLD]

MPLS Multi protocol label switching: The ISP will connect a router for your router to connect to. The WAN here acts like a virtual private network, but traffic is not encrypted. Applies label to packets for the carrier operating at layer 2.5. 
[$, dedicated, <SD-WAN]

Metro Ethernet: (E-Line / EVC / ELAN) Speed of cable is 1 - 10 gbps, P2P point to point line usually fiber cable offering high speeds to connect sites. Can be part of a truly connected ELAN or a Hub and Spoke design (called E-Tree). Connections are performing layer 2 functions. Endpoints are typically switches which the client must provide. 2 cables provide redundancy.
[fast, $$$]

Public Internet connection: Used with a Site-to-Site VPN to encrypt business traffic and business may contact ISP for a business connection. Still public internet, so the connection may slow and sometimes be dropped. Prioritized traffic for QoS quality of service. DIA dedicated internet access.
[slow, $] [VPN > P2P + Frame Relay]

SD-WAN software-defined WAN uses above standard internet connection but solves all of its problems. Makes Public connection obsolete and MPLS obsolete. Good for connections to public clouds. 
[BEST, fast, >MPLS, >DIA, >ATM, $]

ISDN integrated services digital network BRI basic rate interface: circuit-switched service which has usage per minute charges and long-distance call charges. Two 64kbps data channels and one 16 kbps control channel. Can dedicate one for video or calls. Useful if full-time connectivity is not needed and to upload small files once a day.
[$$$, BACKUP for LL + Frame Relay]

VDI using virtual machines as a method of provisioning workstations for corporate users

Example:
A company switches a $$$ WAN P2P connection with HQ site as sole internet → for DIA at each site with VPN and QoS for VOIP (digitizes voice calls and sends as IP packets).

MacBook Air: Power cable: 45W MagSafe 2 Power Adapter: input:100-240V, 50-60Hz, output:4.85V 3.05A

Transistors
P-doping adding Boron or Aluminum with valence of 3 to create a hole. N-doping adds Phosphorus with 5 valence electrons. Transistors have 3 pins (emitter, base,). There are PNP and NPN (serial numbers tell which) type transistors which use the doped connections to manipulate currents. Applying charge to the transistor will open up the other circuit to which the transistor is connected. Transistors should not exceed charge or they will be damaged. A transistor adds charges together as a kind of amplifier. Power transistors get very hot and are connected to a heat sink. 

Vacuum tubes work with charge applied to a pin that heats a coil and sends electrons from the cathode shell around the coil to the anode shell. The anode shell is connected to an output pin that travels through a circuit and returns to the cathode pin.

Cathode ray tubes use a coil to emit electrons from the cathode plates to the anode plates. The first anode plates accelerate the electrons and the next anode plates are angled to focus the electron beam. Magnetic plates are used to manipulate the vertical and horizontal angle of the beam. The beam fires onto a phosphorescent surface which fluoresces the color of the beam (RGB). A grate allows the beam to always line up with the pixels. The beam fires 60 times per second according to the correct pattern. 

Microchips are manufactured from silicon oxide heated with carbon to high temps to remove oxygen and purify silicon. Silicon is a semiconductor and its current shell is close enough to the valence orbit that when enough energy is applied one of the 4 valence electrons can move. Silicon wafers are exposed to light and oxidized to print patterns. P-doping adding Boron or Aluminum with valence of 3 to create a hole. N-doping adds Phosphorus with 5 valence electrons. The oxidized part of the silicon is etched away and other layers are deposited for the cycle to repeat. Printed circuits are cut out from the wafer. Microchips are manufactured in a clean room where dust particles are continuously removed and air is circulated. The room is sealed off by an airlock and workers abide by strict regulations.

Logical Interface
A logical interface (LIF) Is a software entity consisting of an IP address that is associated with a number of attributes such as a role, a home port, a firewall policy, a home node, a routing group and a list of ports for failover purposes. ... Each LIF may be associated with a specific physical interface or device. 

Firewall

In computer science, a data buffer (or just buffer) is a region of a physical memory storage used to temporarily store data while it is being moved from one place to another.
In information security and programming, a buffer overflow, or buffer overrun, is an anomaly where a program, while writing data to a buffer, overruns the buffer's boundary and overwrites adjacent memory locations.
buffer overflow refers to memory that is written outside of the above allocated area and an underflow is the same but its outside below the allocated area

Data Structures:
Array. Each item has index number [n]

Math:
Log base 2:
log2(1) = 0
log2(2) = 1 because 2 = 2
log2(4) = 2 because 2*2 = 4
log2(8) = 3 because 2*2*2 = 8
log2(8000) = 13?
log3(9) = 2 because 3*3 = 9

Algorithms:
Select sort algorithm. Time increases to sort based on array size N
O(N^2) = time to sort

Merge sort. O(n log n). As the array gets larger, it does not increase the steps by as much.
x | y = log2 (x) 
0 | log2(0) = 0 
1 | log2(1) = 0 
2 | log2(2) = 1 
4 | log2(4) = 2 
8 | log2(8) = 3

Graph search. Uses Cost or Weight to find how to efficiently travel a network. 
Start with node with least cost (0). Disregard any path that exceeds previous cost if previous is better. 

Brute force = try each one. O(n!)

Notes:
Encoding security
Documents must not use JIS_C6226-1983, JIS_X0212-1990, HZ-GB-2312, JOHAB (Windows code page 1361), encodings based on ISO-2022, or encodings based on EBCDIC. This is because they allow ASCII code points to represent non-ASCII characters, which poses a security threat.

There is a set of encoding security issues when the producer and consumer do not agree on the encoding in use, or on the way a given encoding is to be implemented. For instance, an attack was reported in 2011 where a Shift_JIS lead byte 0x82 was used to “mask” a 0x22 trail byte in a JSON resource of which an attacker could control some field. The producer did not see the problem even though this is an illegal byte combination. The consumer decoded it as a single U+FFFD and therefore changed the overall interpretation as U+0022 is an important delimiter. Decoders of encodings that use multiple bytes for scalar values now require that in case of an illegal byte combination, a scalar value in the range U+0000 to U+007F, inclusive, cannot be “masked”. For the aforementioned sequence the output would be U+FFFD U+0022. (As an unfortunate exception to this, the gb18030 decoder will “mask” up to one such byte at end-of-queue.)
This is a larger issue for encodings that map anything that is an ASCII byte to something that is not an ASCII code point, when there is no lead byte present. These are “ASCII-incompatible” encodings and other than ISO-2022-JP and UTF-16BE/LE, which are unfortunately required due to deployed content, they are not supported. (Investigation is ongoing whether more labels of other such encodings can be mapped to the replacement encoding, rather than the unknown encoding fallback.) An example attack is injecting carefully crafted content into a resource and then encouraging the user to override the encoding, resulting in, e.g., script execution.
Encoders used by URLs found in HTML and HTML’s form feature can also result in slight information loss when an encoding is used that cannot represent all scalar values. E.g., when a resource uses the windows-1252 encoding a server will not be able to distinguish between an end user entering “💩” and “&#128169;” into a form.
The problems outlined here go away when exclusively using UTF-8, which is one of the many reasons that is now the mandatory encoding for all things.
